# Yaru Theme for [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)

> ncspot is a ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using librespot. It is heavily inspired by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc. My motivation was to provide a simple and resource friendly alternative to the official client as well as to support platforms that currently don't have a Spotify client, such as the *BSDs.

These are config files. They are installed to ~/.config/ncspot/config.toml.
